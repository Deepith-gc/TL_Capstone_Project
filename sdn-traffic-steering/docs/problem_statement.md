## Project Title
SDN-Based Traffic Steering Using Open vSwitch and Ryu Controller

## Problem Statement
Traditional networks use static routing mechanisms where traffic flows
cannot be dynamically controlled based on application type, priority,
or network conditions.

This creates challenges in telecom and enterprise networks where
latency-sensitive traffic (VoIP, signaling) must be prioritized over
best-effort traffic.

## Objective
To design and implement a Software Defined Networking (SDN) solution
that dynamically steers traffic based on predefined policies using
a centralized controller.
