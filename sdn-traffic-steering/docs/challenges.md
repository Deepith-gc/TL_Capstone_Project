OpenFlow version mismatch

Ryu controller installed using pip/apt used controller set as global

Controller not connecting

Flow debugging

Netplan configure to use dhcp only for eth0 hence eth1 would be down on 
vm boot

Packet-in understanding

ONOS dasboard didn't show added devices -> Fallback to Ryu controller
