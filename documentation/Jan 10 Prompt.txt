You are an expert SDN architect, telecom engineer, DevOps mentor, and technical interviewer combined.

I am a fresher with basic exposure to:

* Linux and shell scripting
* IP networking fundamentals
* Virtualization and NFV concepts
* Docker and Kubernetes (conceptual)
* SDN and network automation (theoretical)
* Python basics (scripts and APIs)

I have limited hardware resources (low RAM and storage) and need a solution that is:

* Lightweight
* Deterministic
* Industry-aligned
* Interview-safe
* Guaranteed to work on modern systems

My goal is to rebuild and deeply understand the following project from scratch and be able to confidently explain every design decision:

SDN-Based Traffic Steering Using Open vSwitch and SDN Controller

Critical background you must assume:

* Running Open vSwitch as Docker containers on Windows is no longer viable due to image deprecation and containerd limitations.
* ONOS running in Docker on Windows can start successfully but may fail to establish reliable OpenFlow southbound connectivity.
* Mininet VM provides a stable, native Open vSwitch data plane and must be preferred.
* Previous failures were architectural and platform-induced, not syntax errors.
* Passive controller mode (ptcp) and fail_mode=secure caused complete traffic blackholing.
* Control-plane determinism is more important than feature richness.

Hard requirements:

1. Teach step by step, assuming no hidden knowledge.
2. For every component, explain:

   * What problem existed before
   * Why older approaches fail
   * Why this choice works now
3. Explicitly state what not to do and why.
4. Prefer fewer components over complex stacks.
5. Continuously think like an interviewer trying to expose gaps.
6. Use Mininet VM as the data plane.
7. Choose a controller approach that guarantees OpenFlow handshake reliability.

Deliver the project in this order:

1. Finalize the correct project title
2. Explain SDN traffic steering from first principles
3. Choose the controller and justify it against alternatives
4. Present the final architecture
5. Build the environment step by step
6. Verify control-plane and data-plane correctness
7. Implement traffic steering
8. Prepare viva and interview explanations
9. Suggest realistic extensions without implementing them

Do not rush. Do not assume. Do not hand-wave.
Teach me like you are training a junior SDN engineer whose career depends on this project.

────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDED FINAL PROJECT TITLE
────────────────────────────────────────────

Primary recommendation (clean and defensible):

SDN-Based Traffic Steering Using Open vSwitch and Ryu Controller

Why this title:

* Explicitly names the controller
* Matches what will actually be implemented
* Avoids ambiguity during evaluation
* Aligns with academic and lab practices

Optional advanced variant (only if needed later):

Dynamic Traffic Steering in Software-Defined Networks Using Open vSwitch and Programmable SDN Controller

────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL ARCHITECTURE (LOCK THIS IN)
────────────────────────────────────────────

Windows Host

* Docker Desktop (optional, not required for controller)
* Browser for visualization and testing

Mininet VM (single VM, primary workspace)

* Native Open vSwitch (kernel-based)
* Mininet topology and hosts
* SDN controller running locally in VM

Architecture principles:

* One VM only
* No Dockerized OVS
* No cross-host OpenFlow if avoidable
* Deterministic control-plane handshake
* Minimal moving parts

────────────────────────────────────────────
CONTROLLER DECISION (FINAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────

Chosen controller: Ryu

Reasons:

* Native Python execution
* Direct OpenFlow 1.3 support
* No container orchestration issues
* Deterministic switch discovery
* Ideal for traffic steering demonstrations
* Easier to explain in viva and interviews

Explicitly not using:

* ONOS in Docker on Windows (handshake instability)
* OpenDaylight (heavy, outdated for this scope)
* Docker-based controllers (unnecessary complexity)

────────────────────────────────────────────
NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (DO NOT BREAK)
────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Do not run Open vSwitch inside Docker on Windows.
2. Do not rely on Docker container IPs for Mininet connectivity.
3. Do not use ptcp passive controller mode.
4. Do not leave fail_mode as secure without a confirmed controller.
5. Do not add tools unless they solve a real problem.
6. Verify each layer before moving forward.

────────────────────────────────────────────
RESTART EXECUTION PLAN (HIGH LEVEL)
────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 1: Environment sanity

* Use Mininet VM
* Verify OVS version
* Verify Python and pip
* Verify Mininet works standalone

Phase 2: Controller setup

* Install Ryu
* Start simple_switch_13
* Confirm controller listening on 6653

Phase 3: Control-plane verification

* Start Mininet with remote controller
* Confirm switch registration
* Confirm flows installed
* Confirm pingall success

Phase 4: Traffic steering

* Write custom Ryu app
* Match on IP pairs
* Explicit output port steering
* Live rule updates

Phase 5: Validation and explanation

* Dump flows
* Explain match-action logic
* Explain control vs data plane
* Prepare screenshots and logs

────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS PROJECT WILL PROVE
────────────────────────────────────────────

* You understand SDN beyond buzzwords
* You can reason about control-plane failures
* You know why certain tools fail in practice
* You can design within constraints
* You can explain engineering trade-offs clearly
