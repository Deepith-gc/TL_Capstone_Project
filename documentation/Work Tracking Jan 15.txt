Finalised project title as SDN-Based Traffic Steering Using Containerized OVS Data Plane
Trying to open Docker GUI in ubuntu VM
	Try to use Portainer(Web Based) for GUI

Shifted back to host os(Windows) system

OVS were used in mininet and controller reachability was tested using ping

Mininet → ONOS control-plane connection is NOT established at all
ONOS is NOT receiving OpenFlow connections from Mininet

ONOS does NOT automatically start OpenFlow listeners just because the container is running.


ENTER THE CONTAINER SHELL(ONOS CLI)
docker exec -it onos bash

karaf login into cli 
 Check apps / onos:apps

Can the Mininet VM actually reach the Windows host on TCP 6653?
ptcp:6654 = passive controller mode
OVS waits for someone to connect to it
ONOS never uses this
With fail_mode: secure
If controllers conflict or misbehave → NO FLOWS
	Result:
		ONOS never completes handshake
		No devices in ONOS
		100% ping loss

Failed to add devices to ONOS controller
ONOS container is running perfectly.
Karaf shell works.
OpenFlow handshake from Mininet → ONOS failed.
⚠️ This is exactly the same problem we predicted:
“ONOS in Docker on Windows relies on container networking abstractions which introduce nondeterministic OpenFlow connectivity.”
Even with proper port mapping, ONOS cannot reliably see OVS inside a separate host-only VM.
This is not a misconfiguration.
This is platform limitation.

Updated to latest release of Ubuntu 20.4 LTS mininet vm version and tried to setup a topology with a controller.

Controller was listening on 6653 but ping failed

Troubleshooted ping with a proper topology of 3 h & 2s . Adding flow rules is pending.


****
Try for a simple minimal topology and a complex one and also try to use x11(xterm) for ryu controller in frontend
Xming X server installation for visualization

Check the Code for Correct Imports
The error specifically refers to the line:
from ryu.lib.packet import packet, ethernet, ip
In newer versions of Ryu, the import structure for IP packets might have changed. To troubleshoot:
First, check if ip is available by listing the contents of ryu.lib.packet:
ls /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/ryu/lib/packet/
If ip.py is not present, you may need to modify the import statement. For example, in newer versions of Ryu, the ip module is often imported like this:
from ryu.lib.packet import ipv4
So, you should update your traffic_steering.py script to:
from ryu.lib.packet import packet, ethernet, ipv4


Ryu controller was running from python installed path which was declared global and hence ping was unsuccessful.






WHY xclock WORKED BUT xterm DID NOT (Interview Gold)

Say this verbatim if asked:

“xclock ran in my user context with valid Xauthority, but Mininet launches host xterms as root via sudo. Without preserving environment variables or Xauthority, root cannot connect to the X server. Using sudo -E or xhost +local: resolves this.”
mininet@mininet-vm:~$ xhost
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
INET:172.26.144.1
LOCAL:
INET:localhost
mininet@mininet-vm:~$ xhost +local:
non-network local connections being added to access control list
mininet@mininet-vm:~$
