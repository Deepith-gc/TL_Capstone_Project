🧠 MASTER SDN PROJECT PROMPT

(Ryu + Mininet | Traffic Steering | Interview-Ready)

📌 CONTEXT (DO NOT SKIP)

You are working on a clean, professional SDN lab using:

Mininet VM

Ryu controller (GitHub cloned, NOT pip-installed)

Python 3

OpenFlow 1.3 only

Explicit execution:
python3 ~/ryu/bin/ryu-manager <controller.py>

PYTHONPATH set to:
/home/mininet/ryu

No system or pip-installed Ryu exists

Project root:

~/sdn-traffic-steering/
├── controller/
│   └── traffic_steering.py
├── topology/
│   ├── simple_topo.py
│   └── (future multi-switch topologies)
└── logs/


A minimal, ping-safe controller is already working:

Table-miss → controller

PacketIn handling

Flood-based forwarding

Verified with pingall

🎯 PROJECT GOAL (HIGH-LEVEL)

Evolve from a minimal SDN controller into a real traffic-steering controller that:

Controls forwarding decisions explicitly

Supports multi-switch topologies

Classifies traffic (ICMP / TCP / UDP)

Applies policy-based steering

Uses flow priorities correctly

Is demo-ready and interview-ready

Maps conceptually to 5G user-plane (UPF) behavior

🧩 PHASED EXECUTION PLAN (STEP-BY-STEP)
🔹 PHASE 1 — Baseline Validation (DONE)

Minimal controller works

OpenFlow 1.3 enforced

Controller receives PacketIn

Traffic passes end-to-end

📌 Purpose:
Prove control plane correctness before adding logic.

🔹 PHASE 2 — MAC Learning (Remove Flooding)

Objective:
Replace OFPP_FLOOD with deterministic unicast forwarding.

Tasks:

Maintain mac_to_port per switch (dpid-based)

Learn source MAC from PacketIn

Install flows for known destinations

Flood only for unknown MACs

Reduce controller load by proactive flow installation

Outcome:

Acts as an L2 learning switch

No unnecessary flooding

Flow tables populated dynamically

🔹 PHASE 3 — Multi-Switch Topology

Objective:
Move beyond single-switch demos.

Topology Example:

h1 --- s1 --- s2 --- h2
          \
           --- s3 --- h3


Tasks:

Create custom Mininet topology with ≥2 switches

Verify DPID awareness in controller

Track MACs per switch

Validate inter-switch forwarding

Observe flow tables per switch

Outcome:

Understanding of distributed forwarding

Clear mental model of data-plane vs control-plane

🔹 PHASE 4 — Traffic Classification

Objective:
Identify traffic type and treat it differently.

Classification Criteria:

ICMP (ping)

TCP (e.g., iperf)

UDP (e.g., iperf -u)

Optional: port-based (HTTP, DNS)

Implementation:

Parse packets using ryu.lib.packet

Detect:

IPv4

TCP / UDP / ICMP

Log classification decisions

Outcome:

Controller understands what kind of traffic is flowing

🔹 PHASE 5 — Traffic Steering Logic (Core Feature)

Objective:
Make forwarding decisions based on policy, not just reachability.

Examples:

ICMP → shortest path

TCP → high-bandwidth path

UDP → low-latency path

Specific host → specific path

Implementation:

Use different output ports for different traffic classes

Install flows with:

Match fields (eth, ip, l4)

Explicit priorities

Avoid PacketIn after first packet

Outcome:

True SDN behavior

Intent-based forwarding

Policy-driven network

🔹 PHASE 6 — Flow Priorities & Tables

Objective:
Demonstrate professional OpenFlow usage.

Tasks:

Use priorities correctly:

High: steering rules

Medium: learned unicast

Low: table-miss

Avoid rule conflicts

Verify with ovs-ofctl dump-flows

Outcome:

Predictable forwarding

Interview-grade OpenFlow understanding

🔹 PHASE 7 — Demo & Validation

Objective:
Create a repeatable demo.

Demo Script:

Start Ryu

Start Mininet

Show topology

Run pingall

Run iperf (TCP/UDP)

Dump flow tables

Explain why flows exist

Outcome:

Confident live demo

Clear explanation under questioning

🔹 PHASE 8 — Interview-Ready Explanation

Be able to answer:

Why OpenFlow 1.3?

Why table-miss matters?

Why avoid OFPP_NORMAL?

How controller scales?

How this maps to 5G UPF / SMF?

Difference between reactive and proactive flows?

How policies are enforced?

5G Mapping Example:

SDN Concept	5G Concept
Controller	SMF
Flow rules	PDR/FAR
Switch	UPF
Steering	QoS / slicing
🔒 HARD RULES (NEVER BREAK)

❌ Never install Ryu via pip or apt

❌ Never rely on OFPP_NORMAL

❌ Never debug before verifying flow tables

✅ Always validate with ovs-ofctl

✅ Always build in small, testable steps

🚀 EXPECTED FINAL OUTCOME

By the end, you will have:

A clean SDN codebase

A working traffic-steering controller

A multi-switch Mininet demo

A clear, confident explanation

A project suitable for:

Interviews

Academic demos

5G / telecom discussions

✅ HOW TO RESUME AFTER BREAK

When you return, say:

“Resume SDN project from Phase 2 (MAC learning) with my clean Ryu + Mininet setup.”

And continue step by step.
