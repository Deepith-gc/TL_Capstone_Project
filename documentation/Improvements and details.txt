SDN-BASED TRAFFIC STEERING PROJECT
INTERVIEW & LAB PRESENTATION COMPILATION
=====================================================================

PROJECT TITLE
-------------
SDN-Based Traffic Steering Using Open vSwitch and Controller

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT THIS PROJECT IS (SIMPLE DESCRIPTION)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This project demonstrates how a computer network can be controlled
centrally using software instead of configuring each network device
manually.

A central controller makes decisions about how traffic should flow,
and the network switches simply follow those instructions.

This approach is called Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and is
widely used in modern telecom, cloud, and data center networks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHAT IS TECHNICALLY DEMONSTRATED
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Separation of control plane and data plane
- Centralized decision-making using an SDN controller
- Dynamic programming of network behavior
- OpenFlow-based communication between controller and switches
- Correct handling of ARP and ICMP traffic
- Flow installation and switch forwarding behavior
- Deterministic and reproducible network behavior

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT A NON-TECHNICAL REVIEWER SHOULD UNDERSTAND
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This project shows that:

- Network behavior can be controlled from one place
- Devices do not make independent decisions anymore
- The network automatically adapts when traffic appears
- Policies decide how traffic is handled
- The system is reliable and predictable

In simple terms:
“Instead of each road deciding traffic rules, a central traffic control
system manages all roads together.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. WHY THIS MATTERS TO A COMPANY
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Reduces manual configuration effort
- Makes networks easier to manage and scale
- Enables automation and programmability
- Aligns with modern telecom and cloud architectures
- Forms the foundation of 5G, NFV, and SDN-based systems

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. WHAT IS ACTUALLY SHOWN IN THE LAB
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- A virtual network with hosts and switches
- A running SDN controller
- Live traffic between hosts
- Controller involvement on first packet
- Flow rules installed into switches
- Subsequent packets forwarded directly by switches

Observable proof:
- Ping works
- First packet has higher latency
- Later packets are faster
- Flow tables contain installed rules

---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. KEY OBSERVATIONS TO EXPLAIN (INTERVIEW GOLD)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. First packet latency is higher
   Reason: packet is sent to controller

2. Subsequent packets are faster
   Reason: flow rule is already installed

3. Network works even after controller decisions
   Reason: data plane forwards independently

4. ARP must be handled for IP traffic to work
   Reason: MAC resolution is mandatory

---------------------------------------------------------------------
7. WHAT TO DEMONSTRATE LIVE (SAFE & IMPRESSIVE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Start controller
- Start Mininet topology
- Run ping between hosts
- Show successful connectivity
- Dump flow tables from switches
- Explain controller logs
- Optionally stop controller and show existing flows still work

---------------------------------------------------------------------
8. HOW THIS PROJECT ACES THE INTERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

High-impact strengths:

- Clear architecture
- Incremental development
- Correct SDN fundamentals
- Observability through logs and flows
- Realistic behavior explanation
- No unnecessary complexity

This shows:
- Engineering discipline
- Problem-solving ability
- System-level thinking
- Production awareness

---------------------------------------------------------------------
9. WHAT NOT TO OVERDO (IMPORTANT)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Avoid:
- Heavy GUIs you can’t explain
- Complex frameworks you didn’t write
- Advanced features without justification
- Overengineering for visual appeal

Interviewers prefer:
- Clear reasoning
- Correct behavior
- Confidence in explanation

---------------------------------------------------------------------
10. IDEAL ONE-LINE SUMMARY (USE THIS)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

“This project demonstrates centralized, software-controlled networking
where traffic behavior is dynamically decided by policy rather than
fixed device configuration.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------
11. OPTIONAL VISUALIZATION NOTE (IF ASKED)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ONOS or similar platforms may be used only for visualization, while
keeping the control logic simple and explainable.

The focus remains on correctness and understanding, not tooling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
12. FINAL INTERVIEW TAKEAWAY
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is not about showing many features.
It is about showing:
- understanding
- correctness
- explainability
- relevance to real-world networks
